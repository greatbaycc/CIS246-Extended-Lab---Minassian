Welcome to the Repository for the CIS246G Linux II.
There are two extended projects that you will be assigned during the course 
and you will submit them here.

We will work on the following Labs:
1.  Small Projects Using Commands, Variables and Shell Scripting
2.  File Management
3.  Disk Patitioning

There will be specific directions for each of these labs.  We will talk about the purpose of a 
document repository:  Document repositories streamline the storage, retrieval, sharing of documents, and revision control.
